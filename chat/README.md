# Chat application

We would ask you to implement a real time chat application

On Vitay, our users are recruiters and candidates.<br/>
After the e-references checking workflow, a recruiter needs to contact a candidate before moving forward to the next step. We want to help them with this ask by adding **an internal messaging app**.<br/>

Each user has a wallet. To intiate the discussion with the candidate, **the recruiter need to spend 2 credits** from his wallet. One is going to Vitay wallet. One is sent to the candidate himself.

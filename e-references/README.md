# e-References

You have to implement a basic API to manage `References`, `Candidates` and `Recruiters` for a candidates references management app.

For each recruiter, we have a list of candidates assigned to them, with a collection of references. A recruiter can create a candidate. A candidate can add reference to themselves.
A reference assigned a score to his candidate.

## Back end requirements

- Entity Relationship model
- RESTful endpoints
  - CRUD Candidates
  - CRUD References
  - CRUD Recruiters

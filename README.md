# Stanlay Park Digital Interview

Thanks for taking the time to complete this exercise.

We would ask you to implement a basic API to manage `References`, `Candidates` and `Recruiters` for a candidates references management app.

For each recruiter, we have a list of candidates assigned to him, with a collection of references. A recruiter can create a candidate. A candidate can add reference to himself.
A reference assigned a score to his candidate.

## Back end requirements

* Entity Relationship model
* RESTful endpoints
  * CRUD Candidates
  * CRUD References
  * CRUD Recruiters

Please consider to build this project in a **two hours timeframe**. If you are not covering 100% of this scenario, feel free to send it to us as it is.
